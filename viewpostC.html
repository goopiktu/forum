                Speaking of skills, let me take a few minutes to talk to you about a website called Skillshare. 
                Have you ever wanted to learn how to do something out of the ordinary or interesting? Well you can, 
                by taking classes online at skillshare.com, which are taught by instructors and have their own class rosters. 
                Heck, I learned how to juggle and make a PB&J sandwich the RIGHT way, by using Skillshare. So what are you waiting around for? 
                There are DOZENS of online courses that you can take ranging from Physics, all the way to fingerpainting! Be sure to 
                check for my referral link in the description after watching this video for a FREE week trial courtesy of Skillshare! 
                It's thanks to them I can provide content to you guys as often as I do, 
                so I thank Skillshare for sponsoring this video. Now, back to the topic.
